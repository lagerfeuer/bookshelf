# Bookshelf

## Getting Started

Fork this repository and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Adjusting metadata (like the title) and changing the books can be done by changing `metadata.json` and `books.json` in the `data/` directory.

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deploy

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.
Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

But you could host it anywhere else, since this is a static site.
